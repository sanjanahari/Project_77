<p>Visual Studio - </p>
<br>
<p>To set up visual studio, you must first open your file explorer and create a folder. Next, you must download visual studio, if you haven't already. After opening up visual studio, click on file and then click on new folder. Choose the folder recently created in file explorer. After successfully opening that up, add a new file to your folder by clicking on new file underneath the word "Start". After that, go to the word file and click "Save As". Then rename the file index.html to create an html page, style.css to create a css page, and script.js for a javascript page.  </p>
<br>
<p>Console Screen - </p>
<p>A console screen is used to see what, if any, errors there are within the code. To open the console screen, you must right click, click on inspect, and then click on console. To print anything in the console, you must either open up an html or javascript page. If you open up an html page, you must use the script tag. Everything inside the script tag is used for the console. To print something on the console, you have to code console.log() and fill in the parentheses with either text or a variable. If you want to print text, you have to put it in quotation marks, like this: console.log("Hi!"). If you want to put a variable, you can do it normally, like this: console.log(idk). </p>
